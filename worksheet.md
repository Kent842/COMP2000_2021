  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?
  Both GitHub and BitBucket are code repository hosting sites which allow users to store their code.  
  What service do they provide?
  Bitbucket allows acts as a central hub allowing users to handle all their Git repositories.
  Github serves as a tool which allows developers to track changes to their projects whilst allowing programmers to work together on a single project.

  * Who made the last commit to repository A?
  Matthew Roberts
  * Who made the first commit to repository A?
  Jon Mountjoy
  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
  First and Last commit: Dave Pearce
  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?
  Both projects are still active.
  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?
  The 'data' folder in the Bitbucket repository has the most activity. 
  The folders in the Github repository starting with 'wy' have the most activity.

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints

Red vs. Blue
